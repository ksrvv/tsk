    <h2 >Tutoring has been found to be an excellent way of providing extra stimulus to pupils of all abilities!</h2>

    <p id="white-paper-research" class="body-text WPR-text hidden">Student tutoring has proven itself effective both in providing role models and academic assistance. School pupils often need positive role models to help increase their aspirations and motivation to stay on in school while, at the same time, needing assistance with their learning. Students benefit because pupils have someone to turn to in a non-threatening environment who can answer their questions. When comparing tutoring to teaching, one tutor said, "The distance between chairs is a lot less than the distance between board and desk.<br><br>

        Using university/college students to help children learn in schools offers many benefits to the students themselves, to the institution in which they study, and to the pupils and staff of the schools concerned. For the students the benefits are obvious and quantifiable. They are thrust into a challenging real-life situation where they must work alongside others and communicate with people of widely-varying age, ability, and educational background. This challenge, and the process of helping pupils with their work, develops the students' communication and group-working skills, planning and organizational skills, time management and interpersonal skills, in a way that no activity internal to the university/college can do.

    <p  class="body-text">I analyzed the 3 most popular websites in the field of tutoring on the Belarusian market. All these services provide tutors, but these are either group classes with tutors or classes with experienced, expensive tutors. There is an analog on the American market - go student, but it is not localized for Belarus. This then became my opportunity for the solution.</p>

        and peacefulness.

        <p class="body-text reflection"><span>How did your users respond?</span><br>
        I received positive feedback from both tutors and parents. People find the ecosystem for tutoring very convenient.
    </p> 
    <p class="body-text reflection"><span>What's next?</span><br>
        In a later update, I would like to add the possibility of video conferencing directly in the application, but it requires large budgets and technical specialists. I would also implement completing tasks directly in the app, getting a rating for homework, and a motivation system for the student.
    </p> 
    <p class="body-text reflection"><span>What did you learn?</span><br>
        It was the first time I conducted an interview directly with users, because before I only had experience in surveys. I found it very interesting to listen to our users, as well as arrange for them to test products later, and collect their feedback. I also realized that interfaces are not only about a beautiful picture, but more about usability.
    </p> 
    <p class="body-text reflection"><span>What would you have done differently?</span><br>
        I would have focused even more on accessibility. If I had more time, I would have implemented a dark/light theme. When I was doing white paper research I found a lot of research about accessibility in tutoring, it seems to me that this is a very interesting topic to study, so I would dive deeper into accessibility and improve the application in this direction.
